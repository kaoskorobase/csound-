+ untested in (sub-)patches containing a block~ object with a block size
  other than the system default (usually 64 sample frames)
+ no feedback on csound aborts + crashes
+ temporary files will not be deleted when pd exits due to a signal
  interrupt

+++ installation +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+ change to the csound_tilde source directory
+ edit the makefile to reflect your system installation (pd source and
+ installation directories)
+ "make"
+ "make install" (optional)

  if you omit this step, you'll want to make sure that pd can find the
  csound~.pd_linux shared object file (consult your pd documentation)

+++ usage ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

in pd,

+ right-click on a csound~ object and choose "help" (the csound~ help files
  have to be installed in a common location, usually
  $PD_LIB/doc/5.reference), or
+ send a "help" message to a csound~ object; a short overview will be
  printed on stdout
